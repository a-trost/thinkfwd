            The one thing artificial intelligence will not replace in the next
            100 years is peopleâ€™s ability to apply critical thinking and
            collaboration. Soft skills are really the hardest skills we need to
            achieve.

            thinkfwd was founded by a group of creative entrepreneurs with a
            vision to harness these skills and amply them through curiosity and
            creative thinking to change the planet for the better.{' '}
